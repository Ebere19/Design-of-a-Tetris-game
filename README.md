# Design-of-a-Tetris-game
This project describes in detail the design of a Tetris game using the hardware and software skills learnt during this module. The De1-SoC is utilized, alongside its peripherals. Software flow control using polling techniques is widely adopted and private timer and interrupts are used to control the input push buttons and the game speed. Text is displayed on the LCD screen using the basic font bitmap lookup table.
The game is expected to display different shapes with varying colours, use button inputs to control the falling blocks, display player score, and predetermine the next shape that will appear on the game arena, and restart after the game is over. The project was tested for functionality, together with it associated hardware and software verification.
